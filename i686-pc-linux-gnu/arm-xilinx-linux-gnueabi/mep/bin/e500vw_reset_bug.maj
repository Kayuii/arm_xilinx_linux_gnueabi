// This file works around a bug in the e500v2 core that requires an 
// execution sequence to occur after reset.  The idea is to set a hardware
// instruction breakpoint at the reset address and then execute from the reset
// address immediately causing a break.  Normally go with a breakpoint at the
// current PC would cause a step, but that doesn't work around the core bug.
// MDI has special logic for the reset address that allows for an breakpoint.
